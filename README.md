## thisamericanlife.co

I really enjoy **This American Life**, but I absolutely hate the podcast subscription service through iTunes. Thankfully, the current TAL podcast can be downloaded from their website for free, but I never remember in time, and then I'm forced to listen through their weird flash player on their non-mobile-friendly website. Ruby to the rescue! I wrote a couple Nokogiri scripts, wired up an S3 bucket, snagged this sick domain, and now I'm good to go whenever I want.

## api.thisamericanlife.co

Just for funzies I also decided to create a **This American Life** public API. It's very simple. At the root it will return the 10 most recent episodes. Given a page number it will return the 10 episodes on that page. Given a specific episode number and it will return just that episode. It can also return a random episode for your listening pleasure.

You get the idea. If you do end up using this API for any reason at all, please let me know.
